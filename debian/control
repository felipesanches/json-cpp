Description: MakerBot branch of library for reading and writing JSON for C++
 jsoncpp is an implementation of a JSON reader and writer in C++. This is
 the MakerBot branch of the tree; eventually the Debian port will be 
 retargeted to use the default libjsoncpp-dev package instead.
 .
 This package is a build convenience.
